# Dormant until the project is enrolled in the Apple Developer Program.
# Without a Developer ID Application certificate and notarization, a
# cask install would leave OpenClicky.app Gatekeeper-quarantined — users
# would hit "OpenClicky can't be opened" on first launch, which is worse
# UX than the source-install path (git clone + make install) this
# formula is intended to replace.
#
# To activate this formula, complete steps 1-4 in docs/plan/release-setup.md
# (Apple Developer Program enrolment → Developer ID cert → 5 GH secrets →
# seed the tap repo). The release workflow will then populate version and
# sha256 automatically on each tag push.
